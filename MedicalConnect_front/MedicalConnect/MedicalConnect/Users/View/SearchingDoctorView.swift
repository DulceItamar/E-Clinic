/// `SearchingDoctorView` is a SwiftUI view that allows users to search for medical specialties. It displays a list of specialties and provides a search functionality to filter the list based on user input. Users can select a specialty from the list, which could lead to further actions, such as viewing doctors within that specialty.
/// - Parameters:
///    - dismiss: An environment variable that allows the view to dismiss itself when called, typically used for closing modal views.
///    - medicalSpecialties: A static array of strings representing various medical specialties derived from the MedicalSpeality enumeration. This array serves as the primary data source for the view's list of specialties.
///    - searchDoctor: A state variable that holds the current input from the user while searching for specialties. It updates the view in real-time as the user types.
///    - filteredName: A computed property that returns a filtered list of medical specialties based on the userâ€™s input in searchDoctor. If the input is empty, it returns all specialties; otherwise, it returns a sorted list of specialties that contain the search term.
