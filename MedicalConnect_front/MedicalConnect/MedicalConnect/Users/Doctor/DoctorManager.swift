///`DoctorManager` class is an ObservableObject that manages the state of a doctor's profile. It is designed to handle user input, validate the doctor's information, and provide functionality for saving and updating the doctor's data. The class utilizes the Combine framework for reactive programming, allowing it to respond to changes in state and propagate updates to views that observe it.
/// - Parameters:
///    - doctor: It holds the current state of the Doctor object, which includes personal and professional information about the doctor.
///    - continueAccess: This boolean property indicates whether the user can continue with the next step in the application. It is derived from validations of the doctor's information.
///    - addingServiceLabels: This property stores the input text for adding new services to the doctor's profile.
///    - cancellables: A set of AnyCancellable objects used to manage subscriptions to Combine publishers. This ensures that resources are properly released when no longer needed.
